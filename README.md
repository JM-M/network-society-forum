# BanklessDeSci Community Hub

An open social application for the decentralized science community. Governed and moderated by the BanklessDeSci community. Built on Orbis and Ceramic with love.

## Getting Started (to be updated)

To get started developers should start by creating their `project` and `context` using the [Orbis Dashboard](https://useorbis.com/dashboard). The ID of the context created should be used in `_app.js`.

## Styles

Most of the colors can be updated in the `styles/global.css` file which contains CSS variables applied to the main `html` property.

## Running locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
